# Order Management System

The system has been built with ASP.NET Core architecture. It is a project that I created in a week as a result of the information I learned during my summer internship.
Basically, waiters log into the system and add orders to the system. They can make changes in orders. They can finally get the recipe from the site.

Table page:
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XDbwY4N/smint2.png" alt="smint2" border="0"></a>

Main concept is if a table has an order its color is changing.

Order adding and editing page:

Waiters can change or cancel order with that page.
